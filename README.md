# Artificial Neural Network Adaptive Resonance Theory

**ART**(**A**daptive **R**esonance **T**heory) networks have emerged as a result of studies on the functions of the biological brain in 1976 in Grosberg. This model has 3 main features<br />

**1.Normalization:** This indicates the situation in which biological systems are adaptive to major environmental changes. **For example**, the human being is not disturbed by the noise after a while in a very noisy environment indicates that the system has been adapted and the events in the environment have been normalized.<br />

**2.Parse:** It is very important to differentiate the existing but difficult to see differences between the surrounding events in the decision making and interpretation of the events. Sometimes small details can be vital. The importance of noticing a sleeping lion and a ready to attack lion is obvious.<br />

**3.Short-Term Memory With Details Stored:** Identified differences and environmental events are stored in memory and then turned into action before they cause behavior.<br />

**Notice That:** <br /> 
**1.** ART networks are capable of learning very quickly and resolutely in real time. This ability is not available in many networks. ART networks help to create computers that can learn in real time by supporting hardware that can be used in real time with these features.<br />
**2.** ART networks try to learn self-learning rather than getting the expected outcomes from a teacher

**Structure of ART Networks**<br />

In ART networks, inputs are not classified directly. First, activation of F1 layer is determined by examining the properties of the inputs. The information that comes with the connection values ​​in UDH is divided into categories and sent to the F2 layer. The classification in the F2 layer and the classification from the F1 layer are matched to each other and if the sample fits a specified class, it is shown in that category. Otherwise, either a new class is created or the entry is not classified.
